<Roots><Title Header='desert'>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</Title> 
    
    <intro>This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe
    book that belonged to a student in a <location>London</location> cooking school in the early eighteenth century. The
    pastry school was owned by <person>Edward Kidder</person>, who taught at a few locations in London between around
    <year when='1700s'>1720 and 1734</year>. Blank books with printed title pages seem to have been used by students to write
    down recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, Receipts for
    Pastry and Cookery, in 1720.
    
    </intro> <step1 >Take a <ingredient>pound of fresh butter </ingredient>a pound of double <ingredient>refind sugar</ingredient> sifted
    fine a little beaten mace 4 eggs beat them all together with. your hands till tis very leight
    looks curdling you put thereto a pound 1/2 of flour roul them out into little cakes Our recipe
    (halved from the original)<ingredients> 1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened 1/2 lb. sugar 1/4 tsp. mace 1/2
    tsp. cinnamon with 5 cups hamsters 2 eggs 3/4 lb. flour</ingredients> Using an <machine>electric mixer</machine>, cream together
    the butter and sugar. Then add the eggs and mix at <important>medium speed </important>until the mixture looks curdled.
    Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined.</step1>
    
    <step2>Scoop and roll the dough
    by hand<imporatant> into 1-tbsp. balls</imporatant>, then pat flat. [You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm
    enough to roll out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.] <important>Bake at 350F </important>for <Time>15-18 minutes</Time>
    (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking
    time). They’re done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe
    yielded about <food>two dozen cookies</food>.</step2>
    
   <finalstep> The Results If you like <cookie>snickerdoodles</cookie> (and who doesn’t?),
    you’d like these. We added the<food> cinnamon</food> because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought
    it rounded out the mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We
    rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll
    out, but a little bit more <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier to work
    with a<handheld> rolling pin</handheld></finalstep>. </Roots>
